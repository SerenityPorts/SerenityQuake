  Linux, as long as you build with USE_X86_ASM=N.
- Removed a few pieces of dead/legacy code. No more "-record" and "-playback"
  options (net_vcr) and no more IPX or Serial/Modem networking either.

  having more than one sky texture in glquake.
- Various other minor fixes and code cleanups.

v0.56
=====

  console, but activates very early during startup)

=====
- Remove some no longer required rendering code paths (gl_texsort 0,
  _gl_sky_mtex 0, _gl_lightmap_sort 1)
- Use API generated OpenGL texture handles, instead of our own. This is my
  first baby step before looking at some decent texture management.

- Multitexture improvements (sky, also usable with gl_texsort 1)

v0.46
=====
- Fixed default vidmodes in windows, software NQ/QW (broken in v0.0.39 I think)
- Fixed sound channel selection broken in v0.45
- Fixed scaling of non-default sized console backgrounds

v0.45

- Lots of work on eliminating duplication of code (much more to do too!)
- Tried to reduce the enormous number of exported variables/functions.
- Fixed some of the input handling under Linux...
- Fixed initialisation order of OSS sound driver
- Hacked a max texture size detection fix in (should be using proxy textures?)
- Replaced SGIS multitexturing with ARB multitexture
- Added cvars "r_lockpvs" and "r_lockfrustum"
